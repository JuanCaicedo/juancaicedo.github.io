      <h3 id="me-">Me!</h3>
<p>I&#39;m a web developer, a speaker, and a friendly person.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>Having been raised by parents who were each trilingual, I&#39;ve always been
fascinated by languages. That interest took me into Linguistics in college,
which is what I majored in at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Though using logic and science to deconstruct language will always be an
interest of mine, what I got hooked on was using data to reveal patterns that we
as humans would otherwise miss. That lead me into exploring statistics and
natural language processing, and eventually into programming.</p>
<h3 id="web-development">Web Development</h3>
<p>After college, I decided to start learning everything I could about software
development and the web, which somehow lead to becoming a Java developer for
the government.</p>
<p>Since 2015, I&#39;ve been lucky enough to be a part of the team at Curiosity Media,
where I work on <a href="www.spanishdict.com">SpanishDict.com</a>, the largest online
Spanish-English dictionary.</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<p>What I really find most rewarding in technology is interacting with people.
That&#39;s what makes the working in the web, and js specifically, so
wonderful, the great community of people we get to spend time with.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also one of the organizers for NodeDC and NodeSchoolDC.</p>
