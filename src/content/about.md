I'm a web developer, a speaker, and a friendly person.

Having been raised by parents who were each trilingual, I've always been
fascinated by languages. That interest took me into Linguistics in college,
which is what I majored in at the University of British Columbia.

Though using logic and science to deconstruct language will always be an
interest of mine, what I got hooked on was using data to reveal patterns that we
as humans would otherwise miss. That lead me into exploring statistics and
natural language processing, and eventually into programming.

After college, I decided to start learning everything I could about software
development and the web, which somehow lead to becoming a Java developer for
the government.

Since 2015 I've been lucky engouh to be a part of the team at Curiosity Media,
where I work on SpanishDict.com, the largest online Spanish-English dictionary.

What I really find most rewarding in technology is interacting with people.
That's what makes the working in the web, and js specifically, so
wonderful, the great community of people we get to spend time with.

I'm also one of the organizers for NodeDC and NodeSchoolDC.,
